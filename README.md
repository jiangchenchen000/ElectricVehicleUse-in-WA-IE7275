# ElectricVehicleUse-in-WA-IE7275
Using Python to analyse the Electric Vehicle Use distribution in Washington state and explore the machine learning models that apply. 

# Background
The datasets I chose are from Data.WA.gov: Electric Vehicle Population Data (https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2), Electric Vehicle Registration Activity by Year (https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Registration-Activity-by-Year/tak8-xdcp) and Most Common New Electric Vehicles by Model
(https://data.wa.gov/Demographics/Most-Common-New-Electric-Vehicles-by-Model/yu7n-qgtd), which provide the registration information of electric vehicles in Washington state in terms of maker, model, electric vehicle type, city, sale price and more. There are several use cases for the datasets, such as market research, demand forecasting, sales strategies, charging infrastructure planning as well as environmental impact assessment. 

# Business Goal and Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to delve into the usage distribution and evolving purchase trends of electric vehicles over the past few years within Washington state. This exploration will be accomplished by visualizing the registered vehicle models across various cities, considering factors such as vehicle type, sale price, and condition. By discerning consumer preferences regarding electric vehicles, this analysis will provide valuable insights for devising effective marketing strategies, enhancing sales predictions, contributing to industry development, and guiding charging infrastructure planning.

# Methodology 
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the data and establish relationships between variables, I will employ data mining techniques and exploratory data analysis. This will encompass data cleansing and preprocessing, cluster and correlation analysis, the application of a classification, predictive modeling, and more. Additionally, I will utilize infographics and other visual aids to convey key insights in an easily digestible format.

In the process, I will leverage Python packages, including but not limited to NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, to perform data analysis and visualization, ensuring a robust and insightful exploration of the electric vehicle usage landscape in Washington state.
